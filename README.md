# Edible Bing Bong

A simple mod for the game PEAkthat allows you to eat the plushie Bing Bong.

I made this plugin as a test for writting binary injection mods for Unity.

You can find the mod itself for download [here](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/Moistbiscuits/Edible_Bing_Bong/)

# How to build

You will need your own installation of PEAK
From the games root directory take the .dll files in `\PEAK\PEAK_Data\Managed` and copy the .dll files into this repositories `\lib` fodler
The exact .dll files needed can be seen by veing the `EdibleBingBong.csproj` file

Build the project via runnning `dotnet build` in the terminal

# How to run the mod

TODO, I am still setting up where to host this mod.
